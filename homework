  - Current date will be marked with blue, other dates with something different.
  - Only one monthe will be visible on the page. If one wants to navigate to a different date (in other month),
    he must type the date in the corresponding input (design yourself)
  
task 2. Your webpage will be divided into 2 sections. The first will be the list of students in faculty. It is a table with
student name, surname, course and grade. At the bottom of the section will be a button "Add New". When clicking that button
the second section will open, where it will be possible to add new student (aka name, surname, course, grade.) When clicking
"save" button in the second section, the new-added student must be visible in the first section list, and the second section
must hide.
